It will be an online class using the video conferencing service "Zoom" where the teacher and students can interact. 
Using Zoom breakout rooms, they can interact each other in small groups.

The second, third, forth events were held in June, August, October and neary 100 children participated for each event.

Because this is such a difficult time, we did not just aim to acquire knowledge, but also to give them the joy of experiencing new languages and knowledge, even if they don't understand it, and to experience the wonder of technology that allows them to connect to the world even from home. We are very happy if it has led to a new curiosity in the children.

### Cautions

All classes will be taught in English, but we will distribute the Japanese version of the preparation class on YouTube. You will be asked to watch the video in advance before attending (the recording will be distributed around June 10).

Parents/guardians are asked to stay close to their children as it may be difficult to use computers and other equipment.

It will be a closed class only for those who have applied for the event, but we plan to release the recorded video on YouTube and other media at a later date with participants' faces hidden.

Please turn on the camera as much as possible because the class will be held in a situation where you can see each other's faces via video. If you do not want your face to be seen, please turn off the camera by yourself.

We may use your photos, videos, impressions, works, and posts related to the event for the co-organizing organization's business (including posting on the website and social media). Thank you for your understanding in advance. If you are uncomfortable with this, please let us know at the time of application.

### Materials to be used in class (planned)

An active learning tool "Wooclap", "Kahoot!" an app that allows anyone to make and play quizzes, and "Google Photo" to share photos will be used to share the learning process. "Please check that you have a smooth internet connection and have a google account beforehand.

Internet simulator of code.org will be used as well.
