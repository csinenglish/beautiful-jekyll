"Encryption & CS Quiz"

[Computer Science Education Week](https://www.csedweek.org/) will start from  December 7. So, The first half of the week will be devoted to learning the basics of encryption using [Google's CSFirst UNPLUGGED](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/cs-first-unplugged/overview.html). As a group work activity, we'll do "Send a secret message: try to send a secret message." In the second half, we'll have a quiz competition on Kahoot, which we all love. We'll ask for homework questions from you, anything related to CS (computer science), and there will be a prize for the most interesting question!

### Cautions

All classes will be taught in English.

Parents/guardians are asked to stay close to their children as it may be difficult to use computers and other equipment.

It will be a closed class only for those who have applied for the event, but we plan to release the recorded video on YouTube and other media later with participants' faces hidden.

Please turn on the camera as much as possible because the class will be held in a situation where you can see each other's faces via video. If you do not want your face to be seen, please turn off the camera by yourself.

We may use your photos, videos, impressions, works, and posts related to the event for the co-organizing organization's business (including posting on the website and social media). Thank you for your understanding in advance. If you are uncomfortable with this, please let us know at the time of application.
