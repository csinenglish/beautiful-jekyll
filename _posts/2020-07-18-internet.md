Engineers from Seattle (U.S.A.) and Japan will conduct classes in English, connected in real-time via video conference tool. Everyone will use the same material, and they will be challenged to participate in class with quizzes and small activities.

The first event (Youtube) was held in April, and nearly 90 children and adults from all over Japan, the United States, China, Australia, and other countries participated online! Because this is such a difficult time, we did not just aim to acquire knowledge, but also to give them the joy of experiencing new languages and knowledge, even if they don't understand it, and to experience the wonder of technology that allows them to connect to the world even from home. I am very happy if it has led to a new curiosity in the children.

&lt;Cautions>.

All classes will be taught in English, but we will distribute the Japanese version of the preparation class on YouTube. You will be asked to watch the video in advance before attending (the recording will be distributed around June 10).

Parents/guardians are asked to stay close to their children as it may be difficult to use computers and other equipment.

It will be a closed class only for those who have applied for the event, but we plan to release the recorded video on YouTube and other media at a later date with participants' faces hidden.

Please turn on the camera as much as possible because the class will be held in a situation where you can see each other's faces via video. If you do not want your face to be seen, please turn off the camera by yourself.

We may use your photos, videos, impressions, works, and posts related to the event for the co-organizing organization's business (including posting on the website and social media). Thank you for your understanding in advance. If you are uncomfortable with this, please let us know at the time of application.
