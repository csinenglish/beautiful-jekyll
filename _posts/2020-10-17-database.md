Engineers from Seattle (U.S.) and Japan will be teaching the class in English in real time via the Internet. We will use the same teaching materials and challenge you to participate in the class by taking quizzes and posting photos. Participants will be able to interact with the instructor via the video conferencing service "Zoom". The class will be taught entirely in English, but we will try to make it fun even if you don't understand English very well, so please give it a try!

About 100 children and staff members from all over Japan, the U.S., China, Australia, and other countries, ranging from elementary school students to high school students, participated in the third session in August. We divided the children into Zoom breakout rooms according to their English level, and they introduced themselves in Japanese and English, and used the Code.org internet simulator. We exchanged messages and learned about how the Internet works.

## What is Database?

Have you ever heard of the word database?
Databases allow you to store data and retrieve it whenever you want.
Databases are all around you.
Let's think of the library, for example.
There are many books in the library, and you can go and read them whenever the library is open, right?
If you think of "books" as data, the library is a database containing data called "books".
If you want to write software that works on computers, it is very useful to know about databases.
Why don't you join us to learn about such an important database?
