# Computer Logic

Using questions in the Mystery Animal Questions, we introduced the concept of statements and their results (True or False). Examples we used were “The earth is round” (True) and “Tokyo is in USA” (False).

The words belong to True are: 1, Yes, right and はい.
The words belong to False are: 0, No, wrong and いいえ
