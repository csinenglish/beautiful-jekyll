# Binary Gloves

You need
* a white glove
* black sharpie
* red sharpie (optional)

Step 1.
Using a marker, write the following numbers on the front side of your left glove starting with your thumb - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

This side of your hand is the decimal side (numbers that we use everyday and are made up of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9s)

Step 2.
Flip the glove over and write 1s on the tip of all your fingers and write 0 on knuckle
Right an arrow from pinky to thumb

This side of your hand is the binary side.
