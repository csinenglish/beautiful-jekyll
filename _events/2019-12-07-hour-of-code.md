## Introduction

CS in English has been [teaching computer science](https://sijp.org/category/education/) to students in Seattle, as well as to students in Japan‚Äôs Kumamoto and Fukuoka prefectures through a teleconference system called [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). On Dec 7th, 2019 we held a class called ‚ÄúHour of Code - Let‚Äôs dance‚Äù I hope everyone who was able to attend enjoyed it. This document is the report for those who missed the class. This was the 6th installment of our SIJP classes, and was the last one for 2019. This venue created a fun learning environment, all while engaging students effectively in order for them to learn coding skills. For this, we would like to say thank you on behalf of all of our staff of CS in English for all of the support throughout the classes.

The first week of December is called ‚ÄúComputer Education Week‚Äù due to [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)‚Äôs birthday being on December 6th. During this week, students all over the world study computer science, and at the same time, the event called ‚ÄúHour of Code‚Äù is held to raise awareness for coding by providing a one-hour introduction to computer science for all ages of people.

### Main Theme of the Class

The hour of code this year was a phenomenal time to learn coding. Last year, Kenji witnessed this moment at Open Window School where the code.org CEO, Hadi Partovi, introduced beginner students to advanced coding techniques. He even danced with a Shark costume on during the coding assembly!  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I surprised my daughter at her school <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HourOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HourOfCode</a> assembly. üòÇüòÇ<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leftshark?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#leftshark</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/danceparty?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#danceparty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/firework?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#firework</a> <a href="https://t.co/0E2QJQY725">pic.twitter.com/0E2QJQY725</a></p>&mdash; Hadi Partovi (@hadip) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadip/status/1073364706708967424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Students enjoyed the assembly thoroughly. They also made several impressive dance moves on the code.org platform.

Kenji wanted to bring this atmosphere to Kumamoto and Fukuoka with the help of Internet.

[Kurume University](https://www.kurume-u.ac.jp/site/english/) in Fukuoka joined the class for the first time. Welcome!

 


## Assignments

We prepared and assigned two assignments ahead of class as practice for the students.


### Code.org Activity

We asked students to join our code.org class and work on the first two assignments ([1](https://studio.code.org/s/dance-2019/stage/1/puzzle/1) and [2](https://studio.code.org/s/dance-2019/stage/1/puzzle/2)) as a warm up. Some students worked on more assignments in the course, we appreciate it greatly!


### Wooclap questions

Several software engineers in Seattle joined the class as teaching assistants. So, we asked students to come up with questions

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are the questions from students in Japan and Seattle for software engineers in US by <a href="https://twitter.com/wooclap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wooclap</a><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSinEnglish?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CSinEnglish</a> <a href="https://t.co/cq6C7uVqfy">pic.twitter.com/cq6C7uVqfy</a></p>&mdash; Seattle IT Jp Prof (@SeattleITJpProf) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeattleITJpProf/status/1204213214331817984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the class, software engineer answered these questions.

## Unplugged Dance Activity


### Introduction

First, we introduced ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù and ‚ÄúEvent-Driven Programs‚Äù. Please watch the following video

<iframe width="1029" height="643" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fN0tre9ZvE4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here are some examples of Event-Driven Programs:



*   [https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/aPzVme](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/aPzVme)
*   [https://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/mEkvAG](https://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/mEkvAG)
*   [https://codepen.io/epilande/pen/eZJGpP](https://codepen.io/epilande/pen/eZJGpP)

Now we are ready to dance! Let‚Äôs have some fun shall we?


### Dancing

We invited Yosuke from Kumamoto. He is a professional dancer. He started teaching the dance moves (the instructions can be found [here](https://curriculum.code.org/hoc/unplugged/4/)).

First, he introduced six dances: Dabbing, High Claps, The Star, Body Rolls, the ‚ÄúThis or That‚Äù, and the Floss. You can also learn these dances from this [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Guau5AeuqQCcPz06bfhtTmgt_ykaxKZ_JzkhzcECOcQ/edit#slide=id.g441e51501a_0_20).

It looked like the most difficult dance was the Floss. Here is a video about the Floss dance for beginners:

<iframe width="1143" height="643" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ru1ZZhxLX2I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A lot of kids in U.S. seemed to know about the Floss dance prior to this event, which was a surprise to us and our Japanese audience.

Each dance had its own color associated to it, which is important in the next step, the Control Panel.


### Measures

In dance we use something called Counts. Four Counts is equivalent to a Measure, Two Measures is equivalent to eight Counts, and Four Measures is equivalent to 16 Counts. You can write code based on this. During the dance activity, you can change the dance at every 2nd Measure or 4th Measure.

We had blast at the dance lesson thanks to Yosuke. Not only the kids, but also parents participated in it, we hope they had fun!

From Kumamoto

After the dancing we had small break. In Seattle, we had very tasty sandwiches from [TRES](http://tressandwich.com/) (they gave us some extra for the hard-working kids). We appreciated this act of kindness, thank you very much to the people from TRES.  


## Code.org Activity

After we learned about dance moves, we started a coding program in which the students had to get characters to dance; this was done through code.org. We were so amazed that the kids were able to complete the task without much of our help (Allowing us to have a long break after that dancing workout). [Lesson 13](https://studio.code.org/s/dance/stage/1/puzzle/13) is a section where [students can share their dance moves with others using the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button](https://youtu.be/pIxdBhJb8lc?t=73). We asked kids to share the link to Seesaw so that others can look at them. Here is the [activity](https://app.seesaw.me/pages/shared_activity?share_token=dm6Y3-KrQayQZ9vkeYSdPg&prompt_id=prompt.a258ccd4-1234-401c-bf5e-9cdde6c39067) for that.

Here are submissions from students in the activity dashboard.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We worked on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HourOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HourOfCode</a> Dance using <a href="https://twitter.com/Seesaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Seesaw</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codeorg</a>. Please look at their work of students in Seattle and Japan! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSInEnglish?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CSInEnglish</a> <a href="https://t.co/Gdr0uhI9sq">pic.twitter.com/Gdr0uhI9sq</a></p>&mdash; Seattle IT Jp Prof (@SeattleITJpProf) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeattleITJpProf/status/1204571725981073409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


### Like Time

Before we moved on to each student's presentations, we took 5 minutes for kids to look at others‚Äô work. The work shows up in the journal or the activity dashboard. They can like it or comment on them.

Seesaw allows for liking and commenting on others‚Äô work in the class. We saw a lot of interaction among kids. This is an advantage of using Seesaw.

### Presentation

From the Seattle classroom, we presented several works in the classroom and asked about their work. We were surprised that kids in Japan used English for their interviews and presentations. Also, it was a truly magical moment that their work was able to be presented to all 3 three locations. Here is some of the work by students.

### Comments

Good things about class



*   We got to do an hour of code, and we got to share our work with the class, and see other people‚Äôs work, too.
*   Made abstract concept fun to understand and practice. Students from multiple places can observe each other‚Äôs projects simultaneously.
*   The best part was that kids could make their own creation and then show it off.  
*   The class was fun for my kids, they always ask when the next class will be after the class has ended. Well done again to the team!
*   I enjoyed songs and coding with my friends. I learned a lot with Kahoot, although it was difficult.
*   I learned the fun of the program.
*   I enjoyed the quiz.
*   I enjoyed dancing.
*   It was fun to have game and dance time. Also programming time as well.
*   It seems that he was interested in it
*   I'm glad helpers were kind and polite.
*   I understood programming well.
*   We learned many code things with questions.
*   I enjoyed the dance.
*   I'm so glad I could do something I've never done before. The quiz was interesting.

## Improvements needed



*   My son wanted to make his own character.
*   The content was easy for my 13 years old so he didn't feel overly challenged. Adding additional levels of challenge or stretch goals for older students or students who have been attending the classes for a long time could help keep them engaged
*   I want you to increase the number of drawing and graphs.
*   The screen of Kahoot was hard to see.
*   I want you to take action to be more careful when there is a problem. such as changing the background color
*   I did not have enough time to do programming
*   It was so much fun that I wanted the experience time to be longer.
*   It was my first time to participate, so I thought I should have prepared more.
*   I wanted to make the screen easier to see.
*   In English. So I want you to go ahead in English. Most of the venues in Japan are in Japanese, so it's a shame that I don't have many opportunities to use English.
*   I was sad that my work wasn't presented
*   I want to use the computer more.
*   talk about something more difficult.
