Learning Computer Science in English (CS in English) is a free
workshop that aims to teach - in English - the basics of computer
science to kids in Japan (Fukuoka, Kumamoto) and the USA. Using modern
technology, volunteer teachers and students distributed across both
countries interact with each other over the internet via video
broadcast. Although the classrooms are split across the two countries,
the material and online learning systems are identical in order to
keep the kids as in-sync as possible. The goal of the workshop is to
show that kids around the world can overcome the distance between them
by having fun learning CS together.  A Youtube channel has all the
relevant videos.
