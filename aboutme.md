Learning Computer Science in English (CS in English) is a free
workshop that aims to teach - in English - the basics of computer
science to kids in Japan (Fukuoka, Kumamoto) and the USA.

Using modern technology, volunteer teachers and students distributed
across both countries interact with each other over the internet via
video broadcast. Although the classrooms are split across the two
countries, the material and online learning systems are identical in
order to keep the kids as in-sync as possible. The goal of the
workshop is to show that kids around the world can overcome the
distance between them by having fun learning CS together.
